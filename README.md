			<h3><li>RideCloud is one of Jaime Khublal's personal projects.</li></h3>
			<h3><li>He is currently seeking employment as a back-end, full stack, or software developer in the Denver/Boulder, CO area.</li></h3>

			<h2>Why RideCloud?</h2>
			<h3><li>RideCloud is an easy-to-use, minimal, "lo-fi" ride logging application.</li></h3>
			<h3><li>It won't tell you if you have the fastest time on your local hillclimb.</li></h3>
			<h3><li>It also won't tell potential thieves where to find your beloved bicycle and when it's likely to be there.</li></h3>
			</br>
			<h2>RideCloud is Open Source!</h2>
			<ul>
			<h3><li>RideCloud runs on a Python/Flask back-end. SQL Alchemy is used to interact with a SQLite database.</li></h3>
			<h3><li>To run RideCloud on your local machine, first run ridelog_db_setup.py.</li></h3>
			<h3><li>Add a secret key to line 304 of ridecloud.py, then run ridecloud.py.</li></h3>
			<h3><li>Access your local RideCloud clone at <a href="http://localhost:5000/">http://localhost:5000/</a></li></h3>
			<h2>More features coming soon! Ride lots and check back often!</h2>
